    <p>I am a computer science major, and I absolutly love everything about coding. </p>
    <p>I'm excited for this class because I want to learn more about the front end design of things.</p>
    <p>In all honesty, I'm not too sure where I want a career with this, I just really enjoy doing this.</p>
    <p>Along with pretty much anything tech, I love rock climbing and longbording, along with music.</p>
    <p>Overall, just super excited for the class!</p>
